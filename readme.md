## ðŸ’» Project

This application is a watering reminder for plantlovers and natural born plant killers who always forget to water their plants. It allows you to choose among
8 types of plants. Each plant has their own preset of tips and watering timers. Once you set up your own plant you'll be notified on your phone for every watering
cycle so you never let it die again.
